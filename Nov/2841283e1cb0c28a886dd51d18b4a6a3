The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas has given the Federal Government a two-week strike notice. This fresh notice from the union raises the possibility of fuel scarcity across the country in the coming weeks. NUPENG members basically control the downstream arm of the oil sector and industrial action by the union would ground the supply and distribution of petrol nationwide. Citing the need to attend to oil workers’ welfare, NUPENG stated that it would begin the proposed strike at the expiration of the notice.
