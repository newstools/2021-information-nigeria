He said whether the law was made inadvertently, it cannot override the Constitution, which gives the power of appropriation to the Parliament. He stated that the House will write to the office of the Accountant General of the Federation to ensure that no money is disbursed to the agency in the 2022 budget since nothing has been approved for them by the Parliament.
