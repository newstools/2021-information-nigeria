When we finished we decided to say ‘are we to shake hands and go home?’ We said ‘look, let’s sit down together’. “Truly, General Abdulsalami was gracious enough when we suggested that why don’t we hear from Nigerians what they think about the work of the peace committee. “We called the media, we called civil society, we called the BOT of the two parties, we went to see the president, we went to see the speaker, we went to see the senate president, and President Goodluck Jonathan. “Everybody said the peace committee must remain and we could have gone home but I think that it is to the credibility of General Abdulsalami that we are still going.” He also tipped the former head of state for the Nobel Peace Prize, saying it is long overdue for Abdulsalami to clinch the prestigious prize.
