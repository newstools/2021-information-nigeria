Valentine Ozigbo, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Anambra governorship election, has expressed confidence that he can still emerge victorious in the exercise that is expected to end on Tuesday. The Independent National Electoral (INEC) had declared the election inconclusive on the grounds that the election did not hold in Ihiala Local Government. Professor Chukwuma Soludo has the highest votes in the election, having secured victory in 18 of the 20 LGAs where the election held. Although Ozigbo secured the second highest votes in the election, he won only one of the 20 LGAs where elections held. Addressing newsmen on the eve of the supplementary poll, Ozigbo stated that the election battle is not yet over. He pointed out that there are over 248,000 votes at stake in Ihiala and other places where elections did not take place.

He lamented the impact of vote-buying which he described as a major issue in the polity. Ozigbo stated that as a party without the control of public funds, PDP could not have bought votes. The PDP candidate asked INEC to conduct elections in all the areas where people did not vote. He stated that in many places, people came out in large numbers but were denied the opportunity to participate in the process. However, he said he was only concerned with the complementary election at the moment, adding that he would decide on the next line of action after the election.
