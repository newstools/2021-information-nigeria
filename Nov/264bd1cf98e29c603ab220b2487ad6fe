bab Adebimpe Oyebade, the Nigerian actress, who is popularly known as Mo’Bimpe, has said that she is not ready to put her career on hold for marriage to fellow actor, Lateef Adedimeji. Recall that the lovebirds had been dogged by rumours that they were dating but had vehemently denied it. However, some weeks ago, they finally came out to admit what many already suspected that they were in a relationship and would get married in December. In an interview with Saturday Beats, Oyebade said, “Why should a woman put her career on hold for marriage? One does not affect the other. There is no need for one person to put their career on hold for the other because they can both work together.” Mo’Bimpe also maintained that getting married to her colleague would not affect her career. She said, “I don’t think getting married to a fellow entertainer would affect my career. I will make my marriage work and last long by being cautious. I will also keep praying.” The actress also stated that she was not dating Adedimeji at the times she publicly denied being in a relationship with him. She said, “I don’t think I should come on social media and talk about my relationship. I don’t see a need for that because I am a very private person and almost everyone knows that. I don’t exhibit my personal life on social media. That is the kind of person I have always been. In the interview where I said I was not dating Lateef Adedimeji, I was actually not dating him at that time.” Revealing plans for the forthcoming wedding, which is being anticipated by many of their fans, Oyebade said, “We are not having a low-key wedding because we (have) already invited people for it. A lot of people already know about the wedding. Members of the press are also invited.”
