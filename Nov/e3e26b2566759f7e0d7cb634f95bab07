Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, spokesman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has stated that the north would not be intimidated by threats of secession ahead of the 2023 election. He stated this in an interview with Daily Sun on Monday. Ahmed stated that the north is just as concerned about the violence in the south-east as it is with insecurity in parts of the north.
