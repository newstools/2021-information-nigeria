President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that Nigeria needs $1.5 trillion within a 10-year period to achieve an appreciable level of infrastructural development. According to a statement by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesperson, Buhari stated this on Tuesday at the COP26 side event on improving global infrastructure. COP26 is currently holding in Glasgow, Scotland. President Buhari pointed out that his administration has taken infrastructure expansion in Nigeria seriously, while being conscious of the fact that new investments in critical sectors of the economy would aid lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty by 2030. “There is a nexus between infrastructural development and the overall economic development of a nation,” Buhari said.
