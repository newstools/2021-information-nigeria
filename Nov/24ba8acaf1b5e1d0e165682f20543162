 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has disclaimed a trending photograph involving Obi Cubana. The selfie shows the socialite, real name Obinna Iyiegbu, and a dozen people, posed in a selfie picture. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement on Friday said the individuals are not the agency’s staff. The commission advised the public “not to be misled by another mischievous stunt by Cubana’s publicists.” The Anambra-born club owner was at the EFCC headquarters in Abuja for four days. Obi Cubana was grilled for alleged money laundering and tax fraud. The businessman faces a “serious case”, according to a source. Investigations are still ongoing.
