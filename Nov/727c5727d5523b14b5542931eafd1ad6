No government since Peter Obi till now have failed in that responsibility. Remember that Peter Obi was in APGA, and he performed superlatively when he was in APGA, but the moment he left, the APGA spirit left him, and he never achieved anything ever since,” Oye said. ”If he wants to achieve anything politically, he should come back to APGA. Then we’ll now reignite the APGA spirit in him. That’s how it’s done. Let him continue going from pillar to pole. He cannot achieve anything because APGA gave him a platform, and he took a vow that he’ll never leave APGA until death do them apart.”
