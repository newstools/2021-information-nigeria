The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has dismissed insinuations in some reports that its proposed 2022 budget was padded with N4.5 billion. The Director, Media and Advocacy, NDLEA, Femi Babafemi, stated this in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja. Babafemi said the agency had been inundated with calls and messages since Tuesday, seeking clarification on an alleged insertion of N4.5 billion into the NDLEA’s proposed budget being considered by the Senate. He stated that the amount was allegedly said to be for the construction of police barracks for personnel.
