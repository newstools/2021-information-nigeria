Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare has stated that Gernot Rohr’s fate as Super Eagles head coach would be decided next week. The Franco-German, who was hired in 2016, has attracted a wave of backlash from fans and stakeholders for failing to lead Nigeria to silverware after almost five years in charge. The criticism became intense recently after a series of unimpressive displays through the Qatar 2022 World Cup qualification campaign. Responding to a question on whether Rohr had been sacked or asked to resign on Thursday, the sports minister stated that he could not say much on the matter.
