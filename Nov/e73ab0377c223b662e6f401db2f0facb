Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai has urged citizens of the state not to vote for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections. He made this call while speaking at an empowerment programme in Kaduna, on Wednesday. El-Rufai expressed that the PDP will only destroy his good legacies and also drag the state and the entire country backwards if allowed to return to power.

A bad governor, a PDP governor can reverse this in six months,” El-Rufai said. “Don’t make the mistake of voting PDP back into office in 2023. If you do, things will go back to what they used to be. While we go through our process as APC and bring out a candidate and I endorse that candidate, please trust me that that person will be the better governor of Kaduna from 2023 and beyond.”
