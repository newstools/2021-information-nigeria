Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo has stated that, as a matter of urgency, the Nigerian judiciary must address the issue of delays in processing cases through the courts. He referred to delays in the Nigerian judicial process as the “elephant in the room;” wondering what would happen to the country’s legal profession in “another 50 years given the gridlock in processing cases through the courts and the question of the integrity of the legal process.
