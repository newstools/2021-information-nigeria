 The aides to former Governor Abubakar Bukola Saraki were on Monday re-arraigned at the Ilorin Zonal Command of the EFCC on charges bordering on abuse of office, diversion of public funds and money laundering. Ope Saraki, a cousin to former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and a former Commissioner for Information in Kwara State, Olatunji Oyeyemi Moronfoye, were re-arraigned on separate charges before Justice Muhammed Sani of the Federal High Court, Ilorin. The case, which first geared on May 13, 2015 before Justice A. O. Faji of the Federal High Court, Ilorin has suffered series of setbacks occasioned by transfer of trial judges. Ope Saraki, as the Senior Special Assistant on Millennium Development Goals, MDGs, allegedly received a cash payment of N11,180,000.00 (Eleven Million, One Hundred and Eighty Thousand Naira) from one Kunle Adimula, a sum which exceeded the cash amount payable to an individual. Similarly, Moronfoye while being the Special Adviser on Millennium Development Goals, MDGs, allegedly committed procurement fraud by means of unlawful influence in the award of two contracts involving renovation of Ijagbo Primary Health Centre and supply of medical equipment to two hospitals in Kwara State.
