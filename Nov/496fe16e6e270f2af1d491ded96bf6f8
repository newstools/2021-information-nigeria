Popular activist, Aisha Yesufu has stated that religious leaders benefit from bad governance. She also added that the situation helps them “sell cheap miracles and power points”. She stated this in reaction to a post by the founder and General Superintendent of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, William Kumuyi, which warned believers in Christ not to hate those in government. Kumuyi also spoke against engaging in the destruction of private and public properties in reaction to the failure of those in power to deliver on electoral promises.
