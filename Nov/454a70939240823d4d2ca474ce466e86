Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba Alkali has expressed that inadequate funding is a “critical challenge” hindering the reform of the force. Baba spoke on Wednesday when he appeared before the national assembly joint committee on police affairs. Addressing the lawmakers, the IGP asked that the police should be removed from the envelope budgetary system of the federal government. He also added that this will improve the funding of the force.

He said the force also needs adequate funds to enable it “effectively respond to unanticipated national security emergencies and to support ongoing special operations across the country”.
