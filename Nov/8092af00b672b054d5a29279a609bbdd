The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has mocked the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the November 6 poll, Senator Andy Uba, saying he was duped by defectors. The ruling party in Anambra stated that Uba should be thankful for winning his ward in the election. National co-ordinator of APGA Media Warriors Forum, Chinedu Obigwe, stated this at a press conference in Awka, the Anambra State capital on Sunday. He said Uba’s decision to challenge the outcome of the poll in court would compound his woes. Recall that on Saturday, Uba vowed to take the governorship election to court to reclaim his mandate.
