I started with introducing myself, then subsequent blog posts was me sharing personal stuff which was the order of the day back then but sometime in early 2007, I decided I wanted to stop talking about myself and start talking about other people…lol. And so, it became a gossip/news blog.. which was extremely rare in those days, making The Linda Ikeji Blog one of the pioneers of entertainment news online in Nigeria. A standing ovation please. 🙌😆” Linda went on to celebrate and congratulate herself on how far she has come in the past 15 years and how she has been able to use the platform for the good of the people. “Writing about news and gossip brought a lot of traffic to my blog. A few years later, I had an advert rate and brands started paying to get on my platform. It was life changing! At some point, from 2013 till about 2016, 60% of all advert placed online came to LIB. We balled mehn…lol. And bought a house in Banana…😉😅” She concluded by thanking her readers for supporting her all through the years. “I’m so grateful for this platform. Grateful to all the readers.
