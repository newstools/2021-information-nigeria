Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika has revealed that Nigeria Air will commence operations with three wet-leased aircraft. Wet-lease is an arrangement covering the hire of an aircraft, including the provision of a flight crew and sometimes fuel. He disclosed this during a press briefing on Thursday in Abuja. Sirika said leasing would be the arrangement pending when the company ordered new planes. He added that it would take about three to five years to get an ordered aircraft delivered.
