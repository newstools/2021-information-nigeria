Former Governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa has expressed that it is an “abuse of privilege” for someone who served as a former governor to vie to become a senator. He stated this in an interview with PUNCH. He said: “Why would you serve eight years as governor of a state and then you come again and take one part of the state and say you are going to the national assembly?

As a former governor, the only thing you can look forward to is the presidency. Anything less than that is an abuse of privilege. “Out of 200 million people, you are one of the few chosen to become governor, and after two terms, you come back again and say you want to go to the Senate. What are you going to the Senate to do? As a former governor, ask somebody to go and represent the people there. Then you give the person your wisdom.”
