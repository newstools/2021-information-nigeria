The Joint Admissions Matriculation Board (JAMB) has reiterated its commitment to its practice of remitting its operating surpluses to the government. The examination board stated that the funds were used to fund universities, polytechnics, and other tertiary institutions. The spokesperson for the board, Fabian Benjamin, disclosed this in a statement on Monday.

The first landmark remittance was made in 2017, and the feat was repeated in subsequent years, in line with its belief that rules are made to be obeyed and, at any rate, the board does not believe it should hold onto money that does not belong to it,” the statement noted. The statement said, “In addition, it might also interest the public to know that never in the history of tertiary institutions in Nigeria have the institutions benefited from the board’s operations as they now do.”
