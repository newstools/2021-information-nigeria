Popular Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi has expressed that bandits are committing terrorism but they are not terrorists. Gumi stated this in an interview he granted Daily Trust. He said calls for the government to declare bandits as terrorists was driven by prejudice and bigotry. He spoke before a Federal High Court in Abuja declared bandits as terrorists. “That is unfortunately driven by prejudice and bigotry. IPOB is an organization, it does not mean Igbo. Boko Haram is an organization and it does not mean Kanuri.” “So you can declare Boko Haram terrorists, you can declare IPOB terrorists. In this case what are you going to declare terrorists?
