 Afolabi Oluwole Jacob, a pastor with the Deeper Life Bible Church, has been arraigned in court. He was docked before Magistrate O. O. Sam-Obaleye of Court four, Otta, by the Legal Department of the Ogun State Police Command on a one-count charge of defilement of a four-year-old pupil. It is reported that the suspect is the proprietor of the victim’s school. According to Crime Puzzle, the victim had arrived home from school on November 4, 2021, when her mother noticed a strange development of blood stains in her panties and curiously demanded to know what caused it. The victim narrated how the suspect played with her and used his finger to deflower her in school. The distraught mother on hearing this, reported to the police and the suspect was arrested. During interrogation, several methods were used by the police to extract facts from the minor, amongst which was a repeated presentation of photographs and physical parades of male adults before her who, at every point, pointed at the accused as responsible for the unholy act. A medical report confirmed that the minor had been s*xually assaulted. Therefore, pending an advice from the state Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) in the matter, Magistrate Sam-Obaleye ordered the remand of the accused at the Ibara Correctional Center for 60 days, adjourning the case to January 18, 2021.
