We are hopeful it will become law and Nigerians will be better for it.” Speaking on the reservations that direct primaries may be expensive for political parties to conduct, the speaker said, “I have heard that argument about cost and this is what I have to say. Do you put a price tag to democracy? I don’t think you should. What is too much and what is too little to buy freedom and democracy? I don’t think you should put a price tag to it. So, how much will be okay for him? He should tell us how much will be okay for him.” The speaker expressed optimism that the president will support direct primaries because he is a “very popular man”.
