However, it was realised that his lower limb was affected. The result of an x-ray showed that his cervical vertebrae 3 had collapsed on 4 and it was causing a pressure on his spinal cord thereby causing the retardment of the lower limb. According to him, he was treated for a while and he got better. The actor stated that he noticed that he had some difficulty walking after a while. “After they showed me the procedure and how its been done, I was scared. I was told that they are going to cut open the neck and physically separate the cervical vertebrae three from four and then use an iron plate to plate it with some screws so it can remain permanent. It was scary but I have no choice.” Clem said “I seriously need people’s thoughts and prayers as I go in for this procedural surgery”
