Spokesperson of the Northern Elders Forum, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed has stated that northern Nigeria will back a credible candidate from any region in 2023. Baba-Ahmed expressed that a presidential candidate produced through regional or religious considerations would not be accepted.

We don’t want a president that will be answerable to a portion of Nigeria. We won’t accept it,” he said. “The next president should emerge from a credible election from any part of the country but he or she must be first and foremost a Nigerian president. The north would back any credible candidate from the region who understands the problem, possesses the capacity to solve them (challenges) and can build bridges across the country.”
