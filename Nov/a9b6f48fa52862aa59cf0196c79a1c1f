Lagos commissioner for information and strategy, Gbenga Omotoso has stated that the state has not ordered the demolition of the remaining two structures at the site of the building that collapsed in Ikoyi. Last week, a 21-storey building located in Gerrard road in Ikoyi collapsed, with over 40 bodies recovered so far. Lagos state Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu had inaugurated a tribunal to probe the collapse of the storey building. In a statement on Wednesday, Omotosho stated that an integrity test is yet to be conducted on the two buildings and therefore, it is wrong to speculate that the buildings will be demolished.

It is, therefore, wrong to assert or speculate that the buildings will be demolished,” he said. “The operation at the site of the collapsed building continues. Vehicular movement around the site has been smooth, following the reopening of the road. “Two more bodies were recovered from the site today. The recovery of the two bodies has brought to 45 the number of bodies retrieved from the site. “The identification of bodies of the victims of the incident has continued at IDH, Yaba, Lagos Mainland. Thirty-two families have come forward to submit samples for DNA to identify bodies that they wish to claim. In cases where identification is clear and there are no arguments, the bodies will be released to the families.”
