Nigeria’s Finance Minister, Zainab Ahmed has stated that Nigeria will remove fuel subsidies by 2022 and replace them with N5000-a-month transportation grant to the poorest Nigerians. He stated this while speaking at the launch of the World Bank Nigeria Development Update (NDU) on Tuesday. The minister said the grant will go to about 30 to 40 million Nigerians who make up the poorest population of the country. She stated that the final number of beneficiaries will depend on the resources available after the removal of the fuel subsidy.
