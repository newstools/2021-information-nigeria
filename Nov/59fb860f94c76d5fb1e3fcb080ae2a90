Former Minister of Aviation, Osita Chidoka has stated that governors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) bear the burden of managing tensions in the main opposition party. He stated this during an interview on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily. Chidoka, however, noted that governors cannot control the party’s National Working Committee (NWC). He expressed that this is because of the 13 PDP governors, many were completing their second term in office and some would need nominations to seek other political ambitions in 2023.
