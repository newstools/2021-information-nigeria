 The Federal Government on Monday raised alarm about a black market for fake vaccination certificates in the country. The Chairman of the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, raised the alarm during the committee’s media briefing in Abuja, disclosing that arrangements are in place to vaccinate 50 per cent of Nigerians by the end of January 2022. Mustapha said the Committee had reliable intelligence that an illegal vaccination certificate market has been created in the country. He, however, assured that no vaccination certificate illegally procured would scale scrutiny whenever the need arises as all vaccination records have to be verified as authentic at every relevant point.

‘We have received intelligence and even detected that some unscrupulous citizens are procuring vaccination cards through the black market,’ Mustapha stated.

‘Let me assure everyone that the vaccination records/certificates will be verified and this should serve as a warning to those criminally minded persons to desist because they will be prosecuted accordingly,’ he assured.
