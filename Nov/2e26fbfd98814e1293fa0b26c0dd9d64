 The National Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Samuel Nnaemeka Anyanwu, has said Imo State, South East and Nigeria in general will be witnessing another political tsunami that will mark the end of All Progressives Congress, APC, reign in few days from now. Anyanwu, who represented Imo East in the 8th Assembly, said the PDP in Imo State is set to receive over 30,000 APC members into the party in the offing. He said that the decampees are made up of elected, and appointed political office holders in the state and beyond with their supporters. The erstwhile Senate Committee Chairman on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions disclosure in a release signed by his Special Adviser on Media Ikenna Onuoha made available to newsmen on Friday. According to him,” the ceremony when concluded will mark the end to the selective governance of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state and South East geopolitical zone, noting that his emergence few days ago as National Secretary has opened more vistas for the party.” “Prior to my endorsement as consensus candidate and subsequent emergence as National Secretary of PDP, most power brokers in the state, South East and Nigeria at large had assured me of their willingness to rejoin our party with their numerous supporters if I became the Chief Scribe of PDP” “Today, they have met all necessary conditions for their decamping. I want to reliably tell you that Imo state, South East and Nigeria, in general, will be witnessing another political tsunami that will mark the end of APC reign” Senator Anyanwu, therefore, appealed to those furious with the APC maladministration to use this opportunity to join PDP, adding that such unity will rescue the society from the orchestrated pains, anguish and starvation.
