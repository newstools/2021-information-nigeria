There is a rescue operation that is going on. Police and other agencies are part of the rescue operations, particularly in controlling the crowd, and I am here to sympathise with all that are involved and also to encourage those who are carrying out rescue operations to go about it professionally while providing adequate security,” Baba said. “I think we need to strengthen regulations that are necessary when constructions of such nature are taking place. Not that we don’t have it, we just need to strengthen them — regulations, including what needs to be done and who is supposed to take charge of leading such operations.”
