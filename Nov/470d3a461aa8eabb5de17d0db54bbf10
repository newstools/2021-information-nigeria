He also said the All Progressives Congress (APC)- led government “did not only fail Nigerians, but has also appeared helpless in the fight against insecurity and has shown that it has no capacity to fix the economy, agriculture and education”. He also alleged that a cabal has prevented him from meeting the president over the issue of insecurity, which was why he sought alternative ways to present his position to Nigerians on the security situation.
