 An engineer with the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority, Dasel Nanjwan, has been arraigned by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, ICPC. Nanjwan was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Calabar Division of Court of Appeal for holding a private interest in a N342 million contract regarding the replacement of warehouses and factories at the Calabar Free Trade Zone. The convict was a member of the Federal Government technical committee in a negotiation with General Electric Africa on investments in the Calabar Free Trade Zone as well as the owner and sole signatory to the account of Kwop-ri Services, the company that won the contract. The defendant was initially arraigned by the ICPC before a Calabar High Court presided over by Justice Emily Ibok on a five-count charge which includes knowingly holding a private interest in a N342m contract connected with an office which he is employed, an offence contrary to and punishable under section 12 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act 2000. A statement on Monday by the ICPC spokesperson, Azuka Ogugua, said the convict had earlier been discharged and acquitted on May 19, 2019, but the commission appealed the judgment. The statement titled, ‘N342m contract fraud: ICPC secures conviction of Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority employee, read, “In a judgment delivered at the High Court in Calabar by Justice Emily Ibok on May 19, 2019, the defendant was discharged and acquitted of all charges. “Dissatisfied with the judgment, ICPC filed an appeal at the Calabar Division of the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal in a unanimous judgement set aside the decision of the lower court and sentenced the defendant to three years imprisonment.”
