The Federal Government has described as fair and justice the move by the United States removing Nigeria from the list of countries with religious freedom concerns. This was disclosed by the Special Assistant To The President on Media, Segun Adeyemi, titled ‘FG Hails US For Removing Nigeria From Religious Freedom Blacklist.’ The statement stated that the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed reiterated his earlier stand when Nigeria was put on the list last year, that the country does not engage in religious freedom violation or have a policy of religious persecution.
