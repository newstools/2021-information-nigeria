 Reno Omokri, a former presidential aide, has reacted to the decision of singer, Davido, to give out the N201 million donated to him by his friends and fans. In a post shared on his Instagram page, Reno averred that Davido by his action is much wiser than all those who gave him monies. His post reads: ”Davido is much wiser than all those who gave him monies on his birthday. He understands the spiritual realm and the ways of God. He has secured a soft spot in the Heart of the Creator, by virtue of James 1:27. “I commend him. What a heart of Gold. What a man to watch for the future. Could his life trajectory be like Ronald Reagan’s? Those who gave to him are are different issue entirely. They should read Proverbs 22:16.”   A post shared by Reno Omokri (@renoomokri)
