The Convener, National Peace Committee, Bishop Matthew Kukah, has stated that the Anambra State governorship election would be adjudged as free and fair when no life is lost. Kukah stated this on Wednesday in Awka, three days to the November 6 governorship election. He added that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has a huge role to play in ensuring the process runs smoothly.

The most important thing is to make sure that nobody loses their life, nobody suffers any unwanted injury. “It is the responsibility of INEC. The commission has a threshold that constitutes all we can consider free, fair and credible elections.”
