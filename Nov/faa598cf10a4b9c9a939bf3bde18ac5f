The statement was titled ‘FG set to reform health sector, inaugurates committee.’ It partly read, “Despite the budgetary allocation for the operationalisation of the BHCPF, many Nigerians have not benefitted from it since six years of its establishment. The Joint Working Committee was constituted to provide an effective stakeholders’ coordination mechanism towards the actualisation of the Fund. “Part of the terms of reference for members of the committee is to bring stakeholders up to speed on the status of the Fund, to proffer recommendations as action plans to fast track progress of implementation and to establish the need for the stakeholder coordination framework and other mechanisms to sustain momentum.”
