Thank you for letting me have such a great relationship with both of you independent of your rift…I am delighted I didn’t let your coconut heads let me choose sides…There’s a lesson here – Do not EVER involve yourself in a tiff that doesn’t concern you AND Don’t let social media and the opinion of those who do not matter define your situation!Let God guide you! Love Wins!! Happy Birthday @peterpsquare & @iamkingrudy” See post below:   A post shared by Anita Okoye (@anita_okoye)
