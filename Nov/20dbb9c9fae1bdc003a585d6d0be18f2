Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola has announced that Federal Government is set to commence sale of houses under the National Mass Housing Programme from N7.2 million naira. He announced this on Friday during the unveiling of an online portal for the housing scheme in Abuja. “This is the first time we have a platform that every Nigerian has access to. This provides an opportunity for all Nigerians to apply and ensure a fair process of allocation,” the minister said. He also spoke later on the development in an interview on Channels TV’s Hard Copy.

It’s taking a little more time than before but as minister, I don’t want to be bogged down with petitions. “I get petitions every day. And I don’t want to be bogged down with all those things, so, we want to open the system, get online and if you can pay, pay”. Fashola added that projects are spread across the states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, adding that the highest selling price is N16.19 million.
