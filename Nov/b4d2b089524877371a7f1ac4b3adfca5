The Joint Admissions Matriculation Board (JAMB) has remitted the sum of N3.51bn to the Federal Government as part of its operating surplus for 2021. The 2021 remittance, according to a statement on Wednesday by the board, is in line with the Registrar’s avowed commitment to prudent management of public resources. “This commitment to probity coupled with the adoption of international best practices make for cost-effective operational processes and attendant savings to yield those humongous remittances to government coffers,” the statement signed by the JAMB’s spokesman Dr Fabian Benjamin said. He stated that it has been the norm rather than the exception in the last six years beginning from 2016 Registrar of JAMB, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede remitted the sum of N7billion and repeated the same in subsequent years.

It further said the Board, as led by Oloyede, would continue to prune down the cost of governance and release resources for other needy national prioritised areas.
