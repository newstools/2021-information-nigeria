Elder statesman, Edwin Clark has accused Bola Tinubu, national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of being afraid to speak on the clamour for restructuring of the country. He made this accusation while speaking at a press conference in Abuja, on Wednesday. Clark alleged that the APC leader is keeping quiet on the issue owing to his 2023 ambition. Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos state, has not officially declared intentions to vie for the 2023 presidency, but his associates have begun campaigns for him.

We, however, wish to advise those minority to follow us, the majority, as we mean well for the country.”
