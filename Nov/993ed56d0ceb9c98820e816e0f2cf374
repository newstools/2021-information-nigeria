Former Governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu has revealed the reason northern groups are drumming support for him to vie for the presidential seat. He stated groups are urging him on because they found him worthy to deliver good governance to the nation. Kalu stated that credibility, honesty and the capacity to deliver endeared him to many northerners. “What is responsible for that, is that I have known most of the presidents from the north for a long time, and I have had deep relationships, and am not sure I have disappointed in any of these relations,” he said.

The answer is no. “I cannot leave them because I started with them, and I think staying with them is better than abandoning them, when I feel I am better.”
