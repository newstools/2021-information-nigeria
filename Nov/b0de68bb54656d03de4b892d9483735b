Speaking on the floor of the senate on Wednesday, Adeyemi stated that they should explain to Nigerians how they were able to acquire those properties. The senator made the comments while contributing to a debate on a bill seeking to repeal and reenact the money laundering (prevention and prohibition) bills. The bills were sponsored by Sadiq Umar, senator representing Kwara north, and Suleiman Kwari, senator representing Kaduna north.

They should tell us how they got those properties. We should know who has acquired properties in the name of their families. “Nigeria is bleeding out. Anybody who has held public office in the past should be made to give account. Even those who are sitting here.”
