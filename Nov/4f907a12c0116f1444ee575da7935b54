 The Federal Government has stated that Twitter has agreed to all the conditions it laid out for its operations in Nigeria. The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, who is a member of the committee President Muhammadu Buhari set up to dialogue with the microblogging site, revealed this when he appeared on Channels Television. Keyamo stated that the committee has made significant progress. “The reason why the president took that step is to recalibrate our relationship with Twitter and not to drive them away from our country.” Also Read: Tolu Ogunlesi: Twitter Ban A Win-Win For Nigeria And Microblogging Platform “That recalibration, we have started it and the President graciously added me to the committee. “We also set up a technical committee to interface with Twitter and come up with a lot of conditions for them to fulfill for us to lift the suspension. “It was Twitter that reached out to the Federal Government to say they want to know what and what they can do to straighten up the relationship with the Federal Government and so, we have gone far but I may not, at this forum, let out a lot but we gave them a lot of conditions and they have agreed to all the conditions.”
