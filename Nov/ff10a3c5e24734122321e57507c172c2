A former presidential aide, Doyin Okupe has expressed that the cancellation by the Indigenous People of Biafra, of its planned one-week sit-at-home in the South-East, had proved the group was not a terrorist organisation. He explained that the decision of IPOB to cancel the one-week sit-at-home was indicative of the fact that it believed in the principle of justice, equity and self-determination, for its people. Okupe stated this in a statement he personally signed, a copy of which was made available to newsmen on Friday. He said, “It was heartwarming to learn that IPOB cancelled the Sit-At-Home order, which would have put a lot of uncertainties on the Anambra State governorship elections.

Peace talks and sincere negotiations can resolve in weeks, what violence, war and its attendant bloodshed may not achieve in several years. “May God help and guide our leaders to lead us alright, in Jesus Name. Long live the federal Republic of Nigeria.”
