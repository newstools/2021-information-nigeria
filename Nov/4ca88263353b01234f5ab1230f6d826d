 The intelligence unit of the Lagos State Police Command in Panti, Yaba, has commenced an extensive investigation to know the motive behind a 24-year old Fulani man, Ibrahim Abdullahi, who was caught with 8 pieces of 600mm mortar bomb explosives in the state. According to PM Express, Abdullahi was arrested after he and others at large allegedly smuggled 8 pieces of uncharged mortar bombs inside the Nigerian Army Cantonment, Ikeja, Lagos. “However, they ran out of luck after the security intelligence suspected the movement of Abdullahi and searched the bag he was carrying and discovered that he was in possession of the bombs. “He was immediately arrested and the bombs were recovered from him as exhibits, while his other accomplices escaped and are now at large. “It was not yet certain the motives behind their action and where they got the explosives. Some, who heard about it, suspected they might have smuggled the bombs into the cantonment to bomb the barracks. While others suspected they may have smuggled the explosives for safe keeping for an undisclosed operation in the state since they were not military officers,” The police have already charged the prime suspect, Abdullahi before the Ebute Meta Magistrates Court and he was remanded in custody while the investigation is still ongoing to unmask those behind the act. The motion was moved by the prosecutor, Inspector Olatunde Kehinde, who asked the court to remand the defendant in custody pending the outcome of investigation and Department of Public Prosecution’s advice. The Presiding Magistrate, Mrs. A.A. Oshoniyi, ordered the remand of Abdullahi in custody pending the outcome of DPP’s while the police were said to have intensified efforts to apprehend other accomplices now at large.
