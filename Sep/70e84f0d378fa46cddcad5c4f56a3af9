Defender champion, Manchester City produced a brilliant display to beat Chelsea at the Stamford Bridge in the early kick-off on Saturday. Gabriel Jesus settled a tight affair when his 53rd-minute effort took a touch off Jorginho to beat Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy. Jesus almost added a second when Thiago Silva cleared his effort off the line while Aymeric Laporte should have scored but somehow slid a shot wide from inside the six-yard box.
