Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele has expressed that medical tourism puts a huge strain on the country’s foreign reserves. He stated this on Friday at the launch of Duchess International Hospital, a newly built 100-suit health facility located in Ikeja, Lagos. He called on private sector operators to invest in medical facilities to improve access to healthcare in the country.
