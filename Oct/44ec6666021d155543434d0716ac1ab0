What I can say is that the investigation is still on. Yes, there were high profile criminals that were held in this facility,” Makinde said. “Again, I will appeal that our people should be calm. We have challenges around the country – banditry, insurgency and terrorism. And we can only deal with those issues when we have the people in alignment with what the leadership is trying to do.”
