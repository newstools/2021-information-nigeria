Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege has assured Nigerians that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will respect religious diversity by not fielding a presidential ticket with two people of the same religion in the 2023 presidential election. He reportedly stated this on Thursday in Abuja when he hosted members of the Christian Association of Nigerian (CAN), led by its President, Rev. Dr. Samson Ayokunle. Senator Omo-Agege urged all political parties to balance their presidential tickets among major faiths in Nigeria.
