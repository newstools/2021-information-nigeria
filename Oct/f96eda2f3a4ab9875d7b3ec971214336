Presidential spokesperson, Femi Adesina has expressed that the south-east must play the “proper” kind of politics to have a shot at the presidency. Speaking on the clamour for the south-east to produce the next president in 2023, Adesina stated that it is only possible if the zone aligns with others. The presidential spokesperson said the south-east has always maintained the same voting pattern during presidential elections — and it is not working. “Every part of the country deserves to produce the president and right from my days in the newspapers, I had always been writing, advising the south east on how to get it. But till now, I wouldn’t say they have played the proper kind of politics,” he said in an interview with Vanguard.
