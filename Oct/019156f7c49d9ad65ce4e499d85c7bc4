Chairman of National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Buba Marwa has charged officers of the agency to go all out and root out drug barons and cartels from their hideouts across the country. Marwa gave the directive on Monday at the special operations training graduation ceremony for 143 officers of the strike force corps held at the Nigerian Army School of Infantry (NASI), Jaji, Kaduna state. He stated that the strike force is part of the NDLEA’s efforts to tackle drug trafficking in the country.

Equally, I will implore you to display professionalism, discipline and respect for human rights in your operations.”
