President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed that the treasury single account (TSA), bank verification number (BVN), and national identification number (NIN) initiatives have reinforced his administration’s efforts in tackling corruption. Buhari stated this on Tuesday while speaking at the Future Investment Initiative Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The president’s speech was titled ‘Investing in Humanity: The Nigerian Perspective’. Speaking on his administration’s anti-corruption drive, Buhari pointed out that the TSA, BVN, and NIN, among other reforms, will give comfort to investors.

We believe that this should give investors a lot of comfort.”
