Citizens and legal residents are urged to complete the process before the end of the year 2021,” the statement reads. “The decision to extend the deadline was made further to appeals by the Mobile Network Operators and other industry stakeholders, soliciting for a further extension to ensure better compliance with government’s directive and to avoid widening the digital divide. “The extension would also provide the enabling environment for the registration of Nigerians in remote areas, diaspora, schools, hospitals, worship centres, as well as foreigners, diplomatic missions, those in other areas that were hitherto unreachable, and increase enrolments in countries with a significant number of Nigerians.” The statement further disclosed that over 66 million unique NIN have been issued, with an average of three to four SIMs per NIN.
