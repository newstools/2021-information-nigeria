Bayelsa State government has faulted some schools for flouting government’s directives on resumption date. Education Commissioner Dr. Gentle Emelah, on Monday, stated that it had come to the notice of the government that some private schools had resumed academic activities, against government’s stipulated date of November 2021. He stated that the adjustment of the academic calendar was necessitated by the persistent perennial flood experienced recently.

But for now, all schools are advised to remain closed.” He thereby directed schools that had resumed to shut down and advised them to wait for further directive from the government, as the ministry would not hesitate to sanction any erring school.
