 Nigerian actress, Rosy Meurer, apparently had time to recently respond to trolls who berated her for snatching her colleague, Tonto Dikeh’s ex-husband, Olakunle Churchill. Rosy Meurer addressed their accusations on her Instagram page after she instructed her followers to ask her a question. A question came in, ”Are you happy that you are with someone’s husband now?” The mother of one replied, ”I married a single man. And yes I am happy.” Rosy Meurer also answered a question asking her if she would treat her stepson, King Andre like her biological child if given the opportunity to do so. ”If given the opportunity, absolutely,” Meurer replied.
