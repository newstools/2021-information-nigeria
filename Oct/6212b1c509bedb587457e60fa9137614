Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong has denied any involvement in the impeachment of former Speaker Ayuba Abok last Thursday. Lalong cleared the air on the insinuation making rounds in the social media and elsewhere alleging that he was responsible for the impeachment of the former Speaker. Lalong was responding to a submission by a Jos-based cleric Prophet Isa El-Buba at the annual thanksgiving service of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN). El-Buba had challenged the Governor to restore stability in the Assembly after the impeachment saga.

I did that because of my passion for democratic growth and the strengthening of the Institution. ” Having served as a Speaker who was also impeached, I have no hand in the running of the House, not to talk of the change of its leadership. They run their affairs and do as they wish based on their rules and the law”.
