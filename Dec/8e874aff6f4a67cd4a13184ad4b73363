President Muhammadu Buhari has urged the Turkey-Africa Summit to work with African countries on programs like the Great Green Wall on Environment and Land Management to combat climate change on the continent. President Buhari made the request on Saturday at the third edition of the Summit in Istanbul. He also appealed for specific support to help the African continent overcome terrorism and insurgency. President Buhari stated that the Boko Haram terrorist organisation is still active and preying on soft targets, despite being fractured by internal struggle and decimated by Nigeria’s security forces. The President expressed delight that the Summit convened by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has given due consideration to the issue of terrorism, while also focusing on development and infrastructure in Africa.
