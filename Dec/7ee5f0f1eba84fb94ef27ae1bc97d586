Osita Okechukwu, the Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON) and a founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has requested Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the party’s National Leader, to abandon his bid for the presidency in 2023 in favor of a young person. Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State, told journalists in Abuja a few days ago that he would not refuse some Nigerians’ requests to run for president.
