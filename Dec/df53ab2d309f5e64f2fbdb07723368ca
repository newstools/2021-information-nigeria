The Nigerian Navy has released Instagram comedian and Naval personnel Abdulgafar Ahmad Oluwatoyin aka Cute Abiola from detention. Naval spokesperson, Commodore Suleman Dahun, confirmed his release on Friday. The comedian spent 19 days in the custody of the Nigerian Navy. Following the sustained public interest in the matter, particularly on social media, his employer – the Nigerian Navy – clarified in a statement on November 17 that the comedian was in its custody. Recall that Cute Abiola was detained for posting a video of himself in military uniform on social media, an act which violates the armed forces’ social media policy. Navy spokesperson, Suleiman Dahun, said the policy specifies the dos and don’ts of personnel as well as salient regulations concerning their usage of social media on issues of official concerns. Cute Abiola is not a stranger to controversies. He was arrested in 2020 after his birthday pictures in Navy uniform went viral. His offence was a breach of the Nigerian Armed Forces Social Media Policy. He was later released on May 4, 2020.
