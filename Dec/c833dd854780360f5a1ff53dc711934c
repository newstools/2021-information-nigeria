President Muhammadu Buhari is conspiring with his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), to undermine democracy by repealing the Electoral Act, according to Adamawa State Governor Ahmadu Fintiri. Fintiri stated during an event in Mubi, a major town in the state’s northern region, that Buhari refused to sign the Electoral Act, which had been duly enacted by the National Assembly, because he feared it would not favor the APC in the 2023 general elections. Fintiri made the comment after welcoming APC members who had defected to the Peoples Democratic Party in Mubi (PDP).
