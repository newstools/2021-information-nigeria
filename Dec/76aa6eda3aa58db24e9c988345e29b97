Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun has ordered all serving political appointees in the state who want to run for office in 2023 to resign on or before January 31, 2022, so they can pursue their goals. Kunle Somorin, the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, was cited as saying this in a statement issued in Abeokuta on Tuesday. While such objectives are reasonable, Abiodun explained that the directive was necessary to avoid some observable distractions and a loss of focus in the performance of their existing obligations.
