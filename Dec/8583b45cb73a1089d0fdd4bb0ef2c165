According to a report by The PUNCH, there is panic at the Ayobo Ipaja area of Lagos State over a gas explosion that occurred in the area on Friday. The PUNCH gathered that the gas explosion happened around 1 am on Friday – Christmas eve. Details of the explosion were sketchy as of the time of filing this report. The Chairman of Ayobo-Ipaja Local Council Development, Mrs Bola Shobowale, confirmed the development to our correspondent on the telephone. “It is true. It happened around 1 am,” she said. When asked about the number of casualties, she replied, “I am not in a position to state that. But the explosion is true.” Residents of the area, who took to social media to seek help, hinted that there are casualties. However, our correspondent could not immediately confirm that as of the time of filing this report. One of them, @IamHorlapo, posted, “A year ago, we woke up to a gas explosion in Baruwa. Today, it’s another Pipeline explosion in the same Local Government which has claimed life and property. God, have mercy upon us in this community.” @iamoliver_may22 added, “Guys, please. My street in Baruwa is burning. Guys, please send help to Baruwa… There is a gas explosion and there is a power line in that area.” Details later…
