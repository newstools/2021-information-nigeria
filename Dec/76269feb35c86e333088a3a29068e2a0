The Pope made this claim, according to reports, during a question-and-answer session with reporters on a flight back to Italy from Greece on Monday. “Fleshly sins are not the most serious,” he was quoted as saying. “It was a failing against the sixth commandment (You shall not commit adultery) but not a total one, one of small caresses, massage given to his secretary – that is what the accusation is – there is a sin there but not the worst kind.” Pope’s claim has continued on the discussion, triggering Seun Kuti’s reaction on an Instagram post with the caption, “Pope said it’s not so bad to commit adultery (bad boy) so wives forgive your husbands but more importantly, HUSBANDS FORGIVE YOUR WIVES.”
