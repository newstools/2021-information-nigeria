General Ibrahim Babangida, a former military president, described Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo as a good man with genuine intentions for the country. When the Osibanjo Grassroot Organization paid him a visit in his Minna home on Thursday, the former leader revealed this. “I know the Vice-president very well. He is a good man. A man who has conviction about Nigeria; a man who can communicate with the country and inspire people. Such a man is a worthy person to work with. We need a good man to lead Nigeria. A man who has a passion for this country. Nigeria is a good country; the people of Nigeria are good. You must learn to understand people and constant discussion is key.
