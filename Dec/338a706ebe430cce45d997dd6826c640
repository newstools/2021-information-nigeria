I support the president for not signing the bill and I minced no words on the floor of the senate,” the former Nasarawa governor said. “We should appreciate that Buhari’s refusal to assent to the bill means so much. He is a very articulate person; a very deep person in thought and planning. “Some people felt a bit down with the fact that it is difficult to get two-third of members to return to the chambers. “It is a cause for concern. I am very concerned about it but the remedy is not for us to make laws to promote our personal interest. “The parties have their guidelines and conditions by which people accept to be members.”
