Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar III has expressed that the discourse on the country’s unity is driven by ignorance and emotion rather than knowledge. He stated this while speaking on Wednesday at a national unity summit organised by the National Prosperity Movement (NPM) in Abuja. Abubakar stated that the discussion on Nigeria’s unity should be informed and driven by facts. Represented by Shehu Yamusa III, Emir of Keffi, the sultan said the focus of discourse on unity should be on the right issues with the aim of promoting understanding.

We don’t have to be uniform to be united. The length of our fingers are not the same because each finger has a unique role to perform.”
