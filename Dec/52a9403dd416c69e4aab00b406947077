Read her full post below, “I had hyperemesis gravidarum for the first 25 weeks of pregnancy, and when I tell you, it is the hardest thing I have ever experienced in life, and I doubt any-other thing can be more challenging or more painful.I was bedridden for weeks and could barely open my eyes and talk. All I could do was breathe. I threw up 10-15 times a day. I won’t call it throwing up; it was an exorcism where i felt like a sick volcano needed to erupt way too often. I couldn’t eat or drink anything.

How did something I wanted so much become the most painful experience of my life?
I cried a lot from the pain, and I cried because I felt terrible for feeling so awful because I just couldn’t see past the pain. I know it can’t be easy growing life, but why did I feel like I was dying and getting the life sucked out of me. Why didn’t I know what was wrong with me? Why do they call it morning sickness when you feel sick every damn second. Why is my Dr telling me this is normal! It’s not normal! Why do I see new mums write how happy they are and how it is the most beautiful experience when I Don’t feel that way.
