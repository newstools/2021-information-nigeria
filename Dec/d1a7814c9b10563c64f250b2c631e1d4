 Award-winning Nigerian singer, Davido, has revealed that his father, Adedeji Adeleke, sent the Police after him when he left school for music. The star made this known through a recent interview with an American-based podcast, Earn Your Leisure, which was published on Wednesday. Davido stated that while his dad thought he was at school, he was actually doing music. “I wasn’t in school. I was facing music full time and over the years, he found out that I wasn’t in school and there was a whole lot of drama,” Davido said. “I moved back to Nigeria and then, he wanted me to go back to school. Because he was like, ‘after school, you can go back to do the music and bla blah blah. Just get your degree first’ — which I’ve gotten.
