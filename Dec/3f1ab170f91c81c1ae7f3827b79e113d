 Reno Omokri Tackles Pastors About Tithing Again He has handled ministers who lecture about tithing. Making reference to ministers who say instalment of offering gives divine assurance yet move around with security, Reno said it is possible that they don’t pay to give or don’t have faith in what they tell individuals. He shared this idea on his Instagram page.

Then that same pastor goes out with armed security protecting him. It is either he does not pay his tithe, or he does not believe what he told you. Divine protection comes by faith, not by tithe! In fact, God ordained a day for you to be born and a day for you to die. Tithe or no tithe, no one can kill you before that day. And no one can extend your life beyond that day. Christ never collected tithes. His disciples never collected tithes. Do you know why? Because they were not Levites. ONLY Levites collected tithes because they were prevented from working by God. You see this in Numbers 18:21. New Testament Pastors worked-Acts 30:34. Old Testament prophets worked-2 Kings 6:1-5. The only people who did not work were Levites and pastors are NOT Levites.”   A post shared by Reno Omokri (@renoomokri)
