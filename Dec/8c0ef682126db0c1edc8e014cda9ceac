Bakre Olanrewaju, a leader of the All Progressives Congress in Ogun State, has claimed that the state’s governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, deserves a second term in 2023. According to Olanrewaju, the governor has demonstrated a dedication to leaving the state in considerably better shape than when he arrived. Speaking with journalists in Abeokuta, she said, “The essence of politics is to judiciously harness the resources of the state both human and capital to serve the greater good of the populace. Governor Dapo Abiodun has exemplified this since assuming power in May 2019.
