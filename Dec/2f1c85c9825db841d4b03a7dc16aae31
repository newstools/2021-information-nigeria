 Tonto Dikeh Joins The Voices Of Sylvester Oromoni Nollywood entertainer, Tonto Dikeh, has required the celebration of Sylvester Oromoni’s twelfth birthday at Dowen College premises in Lagos.

How do you lose a child in a safe zone and whose birthday is today? Sending love and light to Master Sylvester’s family and loved ones. Happy birthday young champ, we promise you justice. #justiceforslyvester @dowencollegelagos, we will be leaving flowers and gifts outside your gate. Because today is a child’s birthday that died under your care! Please, if you are in Lagos, leave a little gift and prayer at the gate of Dowen College. Thanks.”
