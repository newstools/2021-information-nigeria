 Activist Adetoun Informs Kemi Olunloyo To Prepare For Showdown Adetoun Onajobi, a Nigerian popular activist, has slammed Kemi Olunloyo, a self-described investigative journalist who sparked outrage with her improbable knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Sylvester Oromoni’s death. Worse, Kemi Olunloyo had accused Sylvester Oromoni of being responsible for his own death, claiming that the Dowen College student died during a cult initiation process to which he consented.
