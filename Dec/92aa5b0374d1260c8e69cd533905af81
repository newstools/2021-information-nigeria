The narrative that President Muhammadu Buhari has not exhibited enough empathy for the country’s security crisis, according to Lai Mohammed, minister of communications and culture, is “glib” talk. Mohammed told a press conference in Abuja on Wednesday that the country’s security situation would have been worse if Buhari had not taken office in 2015. Despite the fact that banditry and kidnapping have exacerbated the country’s insecurity, the minister stated that the president has continued to give the necessary leadership. “Today, we only look at the current situation, without wondering what would have been had this president not taken the bull by the horns, as far as security is concerned,” he said.

The skewed narrative in certain quarters that the President has not shown enough empathy is glib talk. “President Buhari is leaving a legacy of security, infrastructural development, economic prosperity and social cohesion for Nigeria. “This may not seem obvious today, amidst daunting challenges, but posterity will be kind to this president.”
