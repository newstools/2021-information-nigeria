 Whitemoney is overly excited as he announces he has become Tecno Mobile Nigerian brand ambassador. The star is one of the trending conversations on social media as BBNaija 2021 winner and also bagging deals from time to time. Whitemoney who recently releases a new song title “Selense” has been on top of the game since he left the reality show. Few months ago, the reality TV star bags mouth watering deal as  GOtv Ambassador in Nigeria.  “It’s a done deal. Me with TECNO on the next level. A journey I’m particularly excited about. #TECNOxWhitemoney. Whitemoney Geng oya o support me by following @tecnomobileng and buy their products there’s plenty to win this season.” See post below:   A post shared by Chief Hazel Oyeze Onoduenyi (@whitemoney__)
