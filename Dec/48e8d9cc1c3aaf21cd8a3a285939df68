Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, has stated that he has no plans to return to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). On Sunday, the governor spoke at the Government House Chapel in Abakaliki’s 2021 thanksgiving service. Umahi defected from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in November 2020, citing “injustice” perpetrated by the opposition party in the southeast. Umahi denied the allegations during the thanksgiving event, claiming he would not leave the APC due of his “enormous achievements” since joining the party.

As state, we have come first in several ways, and we give Him the praises. “Learn how to give a good gift to God, and it’s by thanksgiving that we can be blessed.”
