Judging from the present mood and realities, we must balance our celebration with the realities that will confront us in the new year. “As we celebrate, let us also be vigilant in our environment. Our security agencies, supported by Amotekun, are everywhere to ensure that we have a peaceful celebration in the state. “Let me on behalf of my adorable Betty, my family, myself and the government of Ondo State congratulate you on this joyous occasion. I pray that we will live to celebrate many more Christmas. “I must not fail to also charge you to observe all Covid-19 protocols as this deadly virus is very much around. Wear your face mask, use hand sanitisers and maintain distance while in public places. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year in advance. “
