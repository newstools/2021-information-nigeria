A strange element came and took our party. “We even allowed the strange elements to occupy seats that we the owners ought to have occupied. I will tell you without equivocation that the state today ought to be among the richest states in Nigeria. So we have to recall all our ‘lecturers’ who went on sabbatical back to the party. We are receiving and harvesting all our members who left the PDP for a sabbatical in batches.”
