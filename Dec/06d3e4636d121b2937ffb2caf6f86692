Omoyele Sowore, a former presidential candidate, has slammed former military President Ibrahim Babangida, IBB, for endorsing Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for the presidency in 2023. IBB and Osinbajo, according to Sowore, are sick jokers who should be ignored. While hosting the Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation (OGO) at his Hilltop mansion in Minna, Niger State, IBB declared his support for Osinbajo.
