President Muhammadu Buhari, according to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue, is a grandfather who should comprehend that the country is collapsing owing to the actions of “terrorists.” In a letter congratulating Buhari on his 79th birthday on Saturday, the governor was quoted by Nathaniel Ikyur, the president’s senior press secretary, as adding that the insecurity endangering citizens’ lives and property is not what the president promised when he took office in 2015. The governor, who stated that he loves Buhari, encouraged him to take immediate steps to safeguard the country before he leaves office, according to the statement.

Yet, no one has been arrested. “The roads have become booby traps where the citizenry are scared to travel on, for the fear that they may be kidnapped for ransom or in some cases killed outrightly. It is an open secret that no one is safe in this country any longer.”
