The secret visit according to IPOB intelligence is being facilitated by some APC politicians in the state. “IPOB will not accept any visit both secret and open, by Buhari to Biafraland while our leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU is still in DSS secret. Our leader has to be released unconditionally before Buhari should contemplate any visit to Biafra land. “Biafrans will lock down everywhere any day he ventured to visit Biafraland until he releases our leader. He will meet empty streets in Ebonyi or any part of Biafra he chooses to visit without releasing Nnamdi Kanu. “Biafrans must be prepared to lock down our territory any day he comes here in our region. Buhari has shown that he doesn’t like us. Our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu cannot be in detention and we are welcoming Buhari in our region. “Biafrans will sit-at-home any day he decides to come and mock us. He will know that the few politicians telling him lies about us don’t have control over the people. Should he decide to proceed with the planned visit, Ebonyi will be on lockdown.”
