Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma has stated that there is no reason the All Progressives Congress (APC) will not be voted back to power since the present administration is “performing well”. The Imo governor spoke with state house correspondents on Tuesday after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa. He explained that the APC has also witnessed a significant increase in its membership in recent times. “What is the prevailing situation that will make APC not win? Is it that you don’t know that 22 states in the country belong to APC?” he asked.
