I was the only party chairman in Nigerian history who called a party conference once, where former President Olusegun Obasanjo came to address the party,” he said. “We debated his speech and made comments about areas of weakness and strength. “In the current APC manifesto, I included a clause that there must be a party conference once a year, where the party puts the president or governor on a chair and ask him to account for his governance. “A situation where parties just elect people and say nothing to them again till the next election, where we are all cringing and crawling for party positions and contracts, is not running a democracy.”
