Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi has distanced himself from returning to the Peoples Democratic Party. Francis Nwaze, Special Assistant to the Governor on Media and Publicity, made this known in a statement on Friday. He described the reports making the rounds that his principal is making contacts to return to PDP as fake. He noted that the publication that Umahi wants to return to PDP is fabricated false report and should be disregarded. “The attention of Ebonyi State government has been drawn to a mischievous publication made in some sections of the media that Gov. Umahi is making contacts to return to PDP.
