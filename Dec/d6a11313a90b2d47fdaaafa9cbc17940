The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced on Monday that it has the ability to oversee any sort of primary election, whether direct or indirect, that political parties may hold. Festus Okoye, the Commission’s National Commissioner in Responsibility of Information and Voter Education, told The Nation that the parties are in charge of organizing and conducting their primaries, while INEC’s role is to supervise them. He claimed that the commission has always done its job of monitoring political party behavior.
