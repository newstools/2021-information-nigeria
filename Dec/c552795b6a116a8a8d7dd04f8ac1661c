The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) national leadership and Senator Andy Uba, the party’s governorship candidate in Anambra State, will decide whether or not to contest Prof. Charles Soludo’s victory. Hope Uzodinma, the Chairman of the APC Anambra State Campaign Council and the Governor of Imo State, stated this to State House media on Tuesday after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. He expressed that the fact that the president had already congratulated Soludo would have no bearing on the decision.
