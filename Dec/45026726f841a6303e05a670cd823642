 Nigerian ace musicians and human rights activists Falz and Seun Kuti have turned down the Governor of Lagos, Gov. Sanwo-Olu’s ‘walk of peace” idea. This is coming after the Lagos State Sitting Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, gave a press briefing regarding the final report of the October 20, 2020 #ENDSARS Massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate. According to the report, lives were lost against the stance of the Nigerian government that no one was killed that day. In the briefing, Gov. Sanwo-Olu invited Falz, Seun Kuti, Mr. Marcaroni, Dele Farotimi, Temitope Majekodunmi, Segun Awosanya (Segalinks); Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, and Commander of Rapid Response Squad, RRS, CSP Yinka Egbeyemi and others to join him in a peace walk as part of an effort to ensure harmony in the state. Reacting to the invite, Falz regarded it as “disgraceful”, stating that the Governor is still trying to deny that the massacre did happen.
