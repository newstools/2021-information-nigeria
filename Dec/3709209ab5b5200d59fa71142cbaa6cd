Her mom Rita went to the house to beg Ned and she Rita chased Cassie out and they quietly buried Gina’s shame which was even more shameful than Laila’s. They only told the story that Cassie wanted of Pa Ned but that wasn’t why. The main issue was when Pa Ned caught Gina and Cassie more than once But they want to disgrace Laila to us, her online in-laws. Even if she did that and so what? Is Ned a faithful husband? Was he not doing small girl Gina behind Laila’s back until she got pregnant and they had to marry? Even tho she lost that first pregnancy according to Gina’s fathe at that time? This is not fair.
