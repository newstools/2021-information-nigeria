The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has clarified that candidates and visitors below the age of 18 years are not required to present COVID-19 vaccination cards before being granted access into its examination halls and facilities. This was contained in a statement issued on Tuesday and signed by the head of JAMB’s media and protocol unit, Fabian Benjamin. The examination body said those mandated to provide vaccination cards are persons covered under the NCDC Vaccination policy.

This category of persons is not covered by the NCDC vaccination policy.” The examination body, however, stated that it would require evidence of being underage to allow any underage individual access to its facilities. https://punchng.com/utme-underage-candidates-not-required-to-produce-vaccination-card-jamb/
