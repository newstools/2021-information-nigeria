This can only happen when our electoral laws are seen to have integrity. “We all want to build a nation with strong democratic values, that instills confidence in investors. This all begins with having a sound Electoral Act. “The amended Electoral Act on the President’s desk has about 25 amendments. Of these, it is only four subsections on direct primaries that are contentious. “Anyway, not all laws are perfect. Nigeria’s democracy stands to gain so much more from the other amendments, than what it will lose from the four contentious subsections. “As Mr. President has said at several fora, he hopes to leave behind a stronger democracy than his predecessors. This is why, like millions of Nigerians and our friends in the international community, I believe that this law will give our nation a framework that ensures that we have a fairer and more transparent electoral system.”
