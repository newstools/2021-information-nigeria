In her words; “You cannot be selective in your call-out. Your outrage is so hypocritical and insipid. What are you calling me out for? A few years ago, when a school teacher defiled a two year old girl in Chrisland school, I posted the picture. After asking questions and getting the right information, I reposted them. The guy threatened to sue me and I reported the case. You all just foam at the mouth calling names. For what? You choose when and when not to speak out. I choose to speak out every time and it’s not for you to tell me or tag me in some meaningless post”. Watch the video below:   A post shared by Kate Henshaw (@k8henshaw)
