Former President, Goodluck Jonathan has called for renewed measures to address the “dead” local government system in the country. He stated this on Thursday when he delivered a graduation lecture at the National Institute for Security Studies in Abuja. Jonathan stated that states must take deliberate steps to revive the local government system. He also said addressing the issues affecting governance at the grassroots will help in the fight against insecurity.

The local government system that is supposed to interphase with communities directly and prevent this is dead in this country,” he said. “Since the local governments are mainly managed by the states now — because we are told that some states even take their money — I think the states must have strong departments that will coordinate the affairs of local governments. “And these departments must have regular meetings with traditional rulers and community development committees.”
