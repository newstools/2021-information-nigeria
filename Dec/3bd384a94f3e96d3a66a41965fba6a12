The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) claims that after the fuel subsidy is removed in 2022, states will clear their outstanding pension commitments. This was stated by the governors’ forum at its 36th teleconference meeting on Wednesday. By 2022, the federal government plans to phase down fuel subsidy and replace them with a monthly transportation stipend of N5000 for the poorest Nigerians. The governors have resolved to include fulfillment of all outstanding pension liabilities as part of the social compact with citizens for the withdrawal of fuel subsidy, according to Kayode Fayemi, chairman of the NGF and governor of Ekiti, in a statement released after the meeting.
