Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Bisi Akande has expressed that it is unfair for Nigerians to blame President Muhammadu Buhari for the country’s current challenges. He stated this while speaking on Wednesday at the launch of his autobiography, ‘My Participations’, which held in Lagos. Akande said Nigerians accuse President Muhammadu Buhari of being responsible for all that is wrong with the country, when the citizens are also the cause of such problems. Akande went on to thank those that attended the event, adding that he wished Buhari could have stayed longer in Lagos. “I’m uncomfortable that each time our president is coming here, he’s always in a hurry,” Akande said.

Let our children eat with him, touch his clothes and let him know that we love him; make him feel younger. But they marched him in, thinking he’s still a soldier. “They marched him in from the naval yard to Eko Hotel and they’re marching him back to Abuja for another event, and maybe that’s the way they’ll march with him throughout today, throughout tomorrow. “I thank you for coming. We love you because you love Nigeria. We love Nigeria and we want Nigeria to be united. We want Nigeria to be peaceful and we want Nigeria to be prosperous. “You have a lot of jobs to do. It’s not yours alone but because you’re our leader, we accuse you of all that is wrong even though we know we are not honest ourselves. “We know we are fraudulent; we know we are deceitful; we know we are cheaters; we know we are doing wrong; we blame you. “I don’t sympathise with you. You applied for the job and you have the job. May your tenure be prosperous, may Nigeria be greater in your time.”
