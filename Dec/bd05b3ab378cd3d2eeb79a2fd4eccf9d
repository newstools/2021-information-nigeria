The other time he missed my calls he called me back and we greeted each other. “But you know some people cry more than the bereaved. In a developed country, when you speak the truth you will be celebrated. Look at how people are celebrating the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu, but here people tag you as an enemy of the government.”
