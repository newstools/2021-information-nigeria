Nyesom Wike, the governor of Rivers State, has expressed that 2022 will be a tumultuous political year that will require a lot of attention. He stated that President Muhammadu Buhari’s refusal to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, would have a ripple impact on the polity, especially if the National Assembly elected to override his veto. On Tuesday, he signed the Rivers State Appropriation Law No. 11, 2021 into law at the Executive Chamber of Government House in Port Harcourt.
