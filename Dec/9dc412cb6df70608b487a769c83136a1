President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the recent attacks on communities across Kaduna, describing the perpetrators as “terrorists”. A total of 38 people were confirmed dead following attacks by suspected bandits in communities across Giwa LGA of Kaduna over the weekend. The development came days after a court proscribed bandit groups and declared them as terrorists. In a statement by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, Buhari said the attackers are “feeling the heat” of recent security operations and as such, focusing on “soft targets”.
