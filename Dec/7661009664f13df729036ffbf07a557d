President Muhammadu Buhari, according to Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has succeeded in keeping Nigeria afloat despite the myriad issues the country is facing. Sponsored assailants, as well as desperate opposition lawmakers, he claims, are seeking to discredit the president’s remarkable successes. Buhari, Mohammed continued, has “without a doubt” put the country on a path of progress and development. On Saturday, he spoke at a program commemorating Buhari’s 79th birthday celebration in Ilorin, the capital of Kwara State. According to him, “President Buhari is a steady hand in troubled times, and that explains why, presiding over the affairs of the country at a most turbulent period, he has managed to keep the nation afloat, and even set it on a trajectory of growth and development.
