The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Owerri Zone, has threatened a total showdown with the Federal Government over the non-implementation of the 2009 agreement. The union stated this during a press conference at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, on Monday. The union stated that it would embark on an indefinite strike as “the magnanimity of ASUU that resulted in various MOUs and MOAs arising from the 2009 agreement has been spurned by the Federal Government.” Leaders of the union from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Imo State University, Owerri, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Igbariam, and Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, were in attendance.

Prof. Fred Esumeh, the Benin Zone ASUU zonal coordinator, revealed this in Benin, Edo State.
