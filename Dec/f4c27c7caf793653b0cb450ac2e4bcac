Former Minister of Aviation, Osita Chidoka has faulted the claim made by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, that the money left behind by the administration of ex-president Goodluck Jonathan could not last for three weeks. Amaechi had made the statement when he appeared on Channels Television’s programme titled, ‘Hard Copy’. Reacting, Chidoka who served as a minister under Jonathan stated that Amaechi’s comment is rather unfortunate and not supported by facts readily available in the public domain.” He stated this in a statement titled ‘Gov. Amaechi’s Statement on 2015 Foreign Reserve: Setting the Records Straight.’ Also Read: Amaechi: Money Left Behind By Jonathan Couldn’t Run Nigeria For Three Weeks Chidoka said, “As a member of the Federal Executive Council that handed over to the current administration, I am disturbed that this urban myth of “empty treasury” is still the subject of conversation by a senior government member. “Also, I am confused about what the Honourable Minister means when he says, “By the time we came in,” as he was not appointed minister until six months after the May 29 Handover. Since he was not a minister on the handover date, it may be pertinent to present him with the facts again. “On May 29, 2015, President Buhari inherited a foreign reserve of $28.6 billion, according to official data still present on the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as $5.6 billion Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas Limited dividends. Also, a 2015 budget of over 4 trillion Naira was handed over to the incoming administration by the outgoing Jonathan government. “Furthermore, the Jonathan administration left a total of $2.2 billion in the Excess Crude Account on May 29, 2015. (As verified by the Ministry of Finance both by the immediate past minister and the incumbent),” he said in parts.
