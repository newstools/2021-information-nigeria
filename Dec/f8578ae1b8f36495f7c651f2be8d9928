It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. “Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease. With you, my life is full of happiness and beautiful things. You’re truly my everyday gladness and I love you tenderly. The most caring, loving, special and beautiful woman I’ve ever met is you, my love. I bless the day we met and I love you to the moon and back. Happy Anniversary, my beautiful wife.”   A post shared by Eedris Abdulkareem (@abdulkareemeedris)
