But regrettably, our democratic gains of the past decades are under threats of unconstitutional takeover of power. “This unwholesome trend, sometimes in reaction to unilateral amendments of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations,’’ Buhari said. The President said Nigeria continues to face security challenges that pose a threat to democracy, calling “on global partners to support our efforts in tackling insurgency and terrorism.’’
