President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the Nigerian Army to up its game in intelligence gathering in tackling security issues. He stated this while speaking on Monday at the opening of the chief of army staff (COAS) conference 2021. Buhari stated that the war against terrorism and insurgency is intelligence-driven, “requiring the gathering of information and processing it into actionable intelligence for the conduct of operations”.
