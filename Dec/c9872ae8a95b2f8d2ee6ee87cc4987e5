He stated this while speaking on Monday in an interview with Channels Television. Adesina said Buhari has already created a reputation of “clean elections” for himself whether he signs the electoral bill or not.

You will find that one election after the other has been better under President Buhari,” he said. “Under President Buhari, the governing party has lost — states, legislative seats and so many elections. “It didn’t use to be. It used to be that whichever party was in power won all elections before by hook or crook; not under President Buhari. “So, his reputation as somebody who wants to leave clean elections for Nigeria has already been made whether the electoral act is signed or not. It doesn’t distract from that reputation.”
