Former Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, Prof. Chidi Odinkalu, has stated that the implementation of the report from the Lagos EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry is a “sacred duty” for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Odinkalu stated this in a statement on Tuesday after the Governor of Lagos State invited some EndSARS frontliners to join him on a “peace walk in Lagos” before the release of the White Paper regarding the findings of the panel. He stated that for lasting peace to occur, the Lagos State Government must show good faith in all matters in the panel report. He added that it would be bad for the government to gaslight Nigerians on the event that occurred at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020.
